## <a id="about-me"></a>üëã About Me

Hi there! I‚Äôm a curious and driven **AI/System Developer** with a knack for solving problems and building creative solutions. I‚Äôm currently finishing my studies at **NBI Handelsakademin**, where I‚Äôve been focusing on object-oriented programming and artificial intelligence.

My recent thesis explored how metadata impacts chatbot performance in RAG systems, and I‚Äôm currently interning as a **Data Engineer at Preem**, working with **Azure Databricks** to model complex business data from different systems.

I love exploring new technologies, simplifying complex problems, and collaborating with others to create meaningful solutions. When I‚Äôm not coding, you can find me cheering for **IFK G√∂teborg**, playing some golf, or spending time with my family.

Let‚Äôs build something amazing together!
