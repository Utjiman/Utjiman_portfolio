## About Me

Hi there! Iâ€™m a curious and driven **AI/System Developer** with a knack for solving problems and building creative solutions. Iâ€™m currently finishing my studies at **NBI Handelsakademin**, where Iâ€™ve been diving deep into object-oriented programming and artificial intelligence. During my internship at **CGI**, I got hands-on experience working with AI-driven projects that tackle real-world challenges.

I love exploring new technologies, simplifying complex problems, and collaborating with others to create meaningful solutions. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me cheering for **IFK GÃ¶teborg**, playing some golf, or spending time with my family.

Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
